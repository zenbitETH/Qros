# Qros

Qros is an NFT based reward system to gamify interactions on the Queretaro City DAO. Users will be assigned certain roles based on their profession and the kind of interactions they perform on the DAO. This includes but is not limited to making proposals for voting, delegating votes, and voting on various proposals. This role is assigned when a user gets validated on the governance DApp. Users can then customize their character with backgrounds, clothes, and accessory layers depending on their skills and engagement in the Quer√©taro City DAO activities. These various layers will be assigned as their own individual NFTs and the user can then have freedom over how to customize their own unique avatar. These individual NFTs will have their own respective benefits associated with them when interacting with participating vendors in the city. At this time the roles include:

1. Artist
2. Digital Creator
3. Athlete
4. Scholar
5. Chef
6. Merchant
7. Pet Lover
8. Wizard

This project makes use of a DAO named VoTaro deployed on polygon. The DAO rewards its users with ERC 20 tokens called Taro tokens for performing various interactions such as proposing changes and voting  The Qros dapp is meant to be an NFT platform that allows users to redeem their Taro tokens for various layers as NFTs. Moralis was used on the backend for their NFT API and authentication functions which make coding the backend a lot easier. What we think is most unique about our project is how we decided on rendering the NFTs. The NFTs are png images that are layered on top of each other to create a unique avatar. Unlike random avatar projects, this gives the user more control of what their avatar looks like and allows them to purchase different layers separately.
